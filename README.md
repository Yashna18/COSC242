# COSC242
COSC242 extends the variety of data types familiar from COMP160 and COSC241, and looks more closely at the algorithms that operate on them. The data structures covered include balanced search trees, hash tables and graphs. Quicksort and mergesort are among the algorithms to be implemented.
