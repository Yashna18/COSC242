Running the program and comparing the two collision resolution functions displays clear merits on both sides. 
First, while running the linear probing function, we can see that computationally, it is the faster collision resolution strategy.
That being said, side by side comparison shows that as the table gets fuller (~70% full), linear probing begins to return with a higher rate
of average collisions and maximum collisions, most likely due to the strong clustering that is produced. 
This proves a nuisance once the table size grows to extraordinary sizes as linear probing must do massive amounts of work to resolve the
collision.
